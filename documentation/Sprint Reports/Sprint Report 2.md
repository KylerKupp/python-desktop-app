## What's New (User Facing)
 * The Atom% graph now uses log to normalize the data.
 * The derivative graph now properly displays the derivative of log(Atom%) using linear regression.
 * Excess rows have been removed from the mean table.
 * The column "Sample Name" has been added the mean table to allow for user input for organizational purposes.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
To meet the client's requirements regarding the Atom% and derivative graphs, Erik and Kyler created a prototype based on their understanding of the client's requirements. The initial prototype didn't behave exactly as the client expected and it also drew out new questions for the client to answer. Over the course of sprint 2, Erik and Kyler both contributed to several prototypes that would be reviewed in weekly meetings so that the team and client could steadily evolve their vision of how the graphing calculations should work. Erik developed the final graphing calculations and Kyler adjusted the mean table at request of the client by removing excess columns and adding user input to identify which mean value belongs to which segment of data.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication with client
