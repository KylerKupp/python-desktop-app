# Python Desktop App

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

Add additional functionality and compatibility to platform for data acquisition, manipulation, and presentation.

### Additional information about the project

The current custom designed software is operational and collects data from our instrument every 2-3 seconds and then processes this information through calculations and manipulations in near real-time.  These experiments can run for 3-8 hours per day and generate a lot of data, some of which is not needed. Therefore, the data is continuously plotted in real-time, and the software allows us to extract key data points and calculated parameters at specific timepoints throughout the acquisition.  Previous students in this course developed a working Python platform that need that needs additional functions and to be able to access data from a new instrument.  The goal of this project is to enhance the function of the current Python system for additional functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.1 or greater


### Installation Steps

Download the executable file and double click it.


## Functionality

Click import to select a file path for aquisition data. Press start to start plotting the data, or plot all to plot the data all at once. Press the mean bars button to bring up two verticle bars that can be used to select data segments. 


## Known Problems

Calculations in module 3 derivative graphs may be inaccurate
